At one point, I got hit right in the back of my neck. As soon as I recovered, I tossed my \(word6.text!) at Brian's head, I missed and instead knocked over a expensive \(word7.text!) and my pellow split open! Fethers flew everywhere, covering the room in a layer of \(word2.text!) feathers, the fighting stopped when we all broke out in \(word3.text!) laughter. The fun ended when we realized we had to clean up the \(work4.text!) mess!!"
